## How Can I Contribute

### Propose New or Changes to Concepts or Classifications

This taxonomy is based on defining and classifying aiming concepts so it is important for these to be as accurate and easiest to understand definitions so these require maintenance and input from the community where you come in

#### Spelling or Grammar Error

1. Make a [Issue](https://github.com/aiming-taxonomy/aiming-taxonomy/issues/new/choose/) 
2. Fill the template with the appropriate information
3. Hit submit and a maintainer will approve and apply the fix or redirect to the discussion topic

#### New Concept

to be created

#### New Classification

to be created

### Become a Maintainer/ Merger

The role of a maintainer/ merger is an important one as its the final say and to implement the communal collective development of these concepts and classifications into the taxonomy.

#### Maintainer/ Merger Criteria

- vested interest in product development, outcome is to have a community-driven common understanding of aim concepts. not someone who would be advancing their own personal interests.
- decent understanding of git concepts, technical ability to handle merge conflicts, respond to pr's, etc
- dedicated to continued development of the repo, so pr's and comments don't languish

#### Application

For the moment there is not a formal procedure for application but that is on the road map and will only be giving people this role in this project if they are highly known for all of these criteria 

but there will be a form set up taking applications when there is a more ridged project and the process can be understood by applicants
