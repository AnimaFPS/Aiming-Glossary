## Accuracy

Moving from point A to point B precisely

## Aim

The skill to get your crosshair on target and optimise its time on target. It is a combination of skills which include: Mouse control, positioning, movement and many more skill and abilities to achieve the goal.

## Anti-Mirroring - Strafe Aim

Moving in the opposite direction as the target you are looking at. Example: They move right on your screen so you move left and the pattern is the same when they go left

## Clicking

The skill to move your mouse to a target to click/ shoot with a semi-auto weapon.

Also known as: `Flicking, Snapping`

## Click-Timing

The process to click and subsequently shoot a semi-automatic weapon when the crosshair goes on to the target

## Chasing

Tracking a target by repeatedly correcting to its current position, instead of reading its movement and committing to that movement

## CPI

Counts of a mouse sensor per inch of real life movement

Also known as: `DPI`

## Deathgripping

When you're tensing your grip on your mouse very tightly

Called deathgripping because of the implications of long term use effect's on the wrist and arm muscles and nerves

## Dynamic Targets - up for implementation discussion

A type of training scenario where the target does not move. Often referring to clicking targets

## Evasive - Switching

A sub-category of switching for bots that change direction often

## Kovaak's Specific Scenario Naming conventions

- Air Nuns: “Air NO UFO NO SKYBOTS”
- b180, b180t, etc.: “Bounce 180,” “Bounce 180 Tracking,” etc.
- 1w6t, 1w6ts, 1w2ts reload, etc.: “1wall 6targets small,” etc.
- 1w2ts reload: Actually the name of the scenario
- CLSI, CFSI, CFSEI, etc.: “Close Long Strafes Invincible,” “Close Fast Strafes Easy Invincible,” etc.
- patts, kints, voxts, voxtarget, etc.: “patTargetSwitch,” “kinTargetSwitch,” etc.
- Pasu: The name of the guy who requested original 1w5targets pasu scenario but often refers to clicking scenarios with moving dots
- Goated: The scenario is improved in some regard that doesn't fall under the reload, thin, small, harder, easy, etc naming convention

## Leading

Aiming in front of the target’s path

## Mirroring - Strafe Aim

Moving in the same direction as the target you are looking at. Example: They move right on your screen so you move right and the pattern is the same when they go left

## Mouse Control

The ability to move the mouse and respectively the crosshair to the position you want smoothly or to stay on target and with speed and many other factors that make good aim and to adapt mouse movements based on visual or audio feedback.

Also known as: `Raw Aim`

## Microcorrection

A small movement of the mouse to correct the crosshair on to a target due to a lack of complete mouse movement or a lack of movement

## Overflick

While performing a movement to acquire a target and the crosshair goes beyond the targets location or desired target

## Predicting

Guessing where a target is going to be in the near future based on movement patterns

## Precise - Tracking

A sub-category of tracking for targets that are 

## Reactivity

Determining the change in movement of a target and subsequently reacting to it - specifically, the rate at which you can do this
Also a sub-category of tracking for targets that change direction or speed often

## Reacquisition

The motion to place your crosshair back onto the target after it falls off and is no longer hitting

## Reading (Skills)

Skills that require comprehension around where enemies are and how they are moving to predict or to better identify a target.

## Routing

Determining the best next series of targets, forming a mental route between targets

## Sensitivity

A unit or value that fundamentally describes how much you will turn in-game when you move your mouse an arbitrary distance

## Static (Dots/Clicking)

A type of training scenario where the target does not move. Often referring to precision clicking targets

## Strafe aim

The ability to change direction of movement of your own character whenever and only when the target you’re aiming at changes direction.

## Speed/Acceleration

How fast you move your crosshair from point A to point B

## Smoothness

Ability to move the mouse at consistent speed/acceleration (at a consistency determined by your reading)

## Switching

Moving from point A to point B as soon as possible after completing a hit or kill. Either or both of point A or B can be a static or moving target.

Also known as: `Target Switching`

## Target Acquisition

The process to acquire a target by sight or more likely to get your crosshair on a target

## Tracking

The skill to maintain your crosshair on a target for a long period of time while it moves and can reacquire the same target after it changes direction. Often long time-to-kill targets with a high fire-rate weapon.

## Tracing/Pathing

How you move your crosshair from point A to point B

## Trailing

Aiming behind a target’s path (or - if the target is moving - the original position of the target when it was visually selected)

Also known as: `Tailing`

## Underflick

While performing a movement to acquire a target and the crosshair does not go further enough to the targets location or desired target
