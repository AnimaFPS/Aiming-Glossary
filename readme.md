## Accuracy

Moving from point A to point B precisely

## Aim

The skill to get your crosshair on target and optimise its time on target. It is a combination of skills which include: Mouse control, positioning, movement and many more skill and abilities to achieve the goal.

## Anti-Mirroring - Strafe Aim

Moving in the opposite direction as the target you are looking at. Example: They move right on your screen so you move left and the pattern is the same when they go left

## Clicking

The skill to move your mouse to a target to click/ shoot with a semi-auto weapon.

## Click-Timing

The process to click and subsequently shoot a semi-automatic weapon when the crosshair goes on to the target

## Chasing

Tracking a target by repeatedly correcting to its current position, instead of reading its movement and committing to that movement

## CPI

Counts of a mouse sensor per inch of real life movement

Also known as: `DPI`

## Kovaak's Specific Scenario Naming conventions

- Air Nuns: “Air NO UFO NO SKYBOTS”
- b180, b180t, etc.: “Bounce 180,” “Bounce 180 Tracking,” etc.
- 1w6t, 1w6ts, 1w2ts reload, etc.: “1wall 6targets small,” etc.
- 1w2ts reload: Actually the name of the scenario
- CLSI, CFSI, CFSEI, etc.: “Close Long Strafes Invincible,” “Close Fast Strafes Easy Invincible,” etc.
- patts, kints, voxts, voxtarget, etc.: “patTargetSwitch,” “kinTargetSwitch,” etc.
- Pasu:  The name of the guy who requested original 1w5targets pasu scenario but often refers to clicking scenarios with moving dots

## Leading

Aiming in front of the target’s path

## Mirroring - Strafe Aim

Moving in the same direction as the target you are looking at. Example: They move right on your screen so you move right and the pattern is the same when they go left

## Mouse Control

The ability to move the mouse and respectively the crosshair to the position you want smoothly or to stay on target and with speed and many other factors that make good aim and to adapt mouse movements based on visual or audio feedback.

Also known as: `Raw Aim`

## Overflick

While performing a movement to acquire a target and the crosshair goes beyond the targets location or desired target

## Predicting

Guessing where a target is going to be in the near future based on movement patterns

## Reactivity

Determining the change in movement of a target and subsequently reacting to it - specifically, the rate at which you can do this

## Reading (Skills)

Skills that require comprehension around where enemies are and how they are moving to predict or to better identify a target.

## Reacquisition

The motion to place your crosshair back onto the target after it falls off and is no longer hitting

## Routing

Determining the best next series of targets, forming a mental route between targets

## Sensitivity 

A unit that fundamentally describes how much you will turn in-game when you move your mouse an arbitrary distance

## Static (Dots/Clicking)

A type of training scenario where the target does not move. Often referring to precision clicking targets

## Strafe aim

The ability to change direction of movement of your own character whenever and only when the target you’re aiming at changes direction.

## Speed/Acceleration

Moving from point A to point B quickly

## Smoothness

Ability to move the mouse at consistent speed/acceleration (at a consistency determined by your reading)

## Tailing/Trailing

Aiming behind a target’s path (or - if the target is moving - the original position of the target when it was visually selected)

## (Target) Switching

Moving from point A to point B as soon as possible after completing a hit or kill. Either or both of point A or B can be a static or moving target.

## Tracking

The skill to maintain your crosshair on a target for a long period of time while it moves and can reacquire the same target after it changes direction. Often long time-to-kill targets with a high fire-rate weapon.

## Tracing/Pathing

Moving from point A to point B in a direct line

## Underflick

While performing a movement to acquire a target and the crosshair does not go further enough to the targets location or desired target
