Also known as: `Aim categories`

## Bots

In aim trainers, these are the targets that are programmed by map creators to perform actions on screen and become the targets that the player eliminates in order to improve their [aim](#aim).

Also known as: `Targets, Dots`

## Clicking

The process of moving your mouse to a target to click/shoot with a semi-auto weapon.

Also known as: `Click-timing`

## Clicking - Static

A type of training [scenario](#scenario) featuring targets that do not move which are eliminated with a single click.

Also known as: `Static dots`

## Clicking - Dynamic

A type of training [scenario](#scenario) featuring moving targets that are eliminated with a single click.

Also known as: `Kinetic, Moving Dots`

## Chasing

[Tracking](#tracing) a target by repeatedly correcting to its current position, instead of [reading](#reading-skills) its movement and committing to that movement.

Also known as: `Over-predicting`

## Cheesing

A category of techniques that are used specifically to raise scores in such a way that it exploites the [scenario](#scenario) design and neglects the use of training for improved in-game performance.

## Crosshair Uptime

The messurement of time that your crosshair remains within the boundries of the target/on target.

## Crosshair Placement

The process to put and acquire the optimal location for one's crosshair to be placed to maximize damage uptime, time to initial damage, or total damage.

## CPI

Counts of a mouse sensor per inch of real life movement.

Also known as: `DPI`

## Deathgripping

When you're overly tensing your mousegrip, resulting in poor habits that can lead to injury over time.
The term 'deathgrip' comes from the negative health impacts on your arm and wrist muscles and nerves over long periods of use.

Also known as: `Overgripping`

## Edge Tracking

The concept of placing your crosshair on the trailing edge/half of a target's hitbox that moves mostly in 2 oppisite directions.

## Field of View (FOV)

The extent of the observable world that is seen at any given moment often referring to the angle value of the horizontal or vertical Field of View available to a player.

## Flicking

Quickly moving your crosshair to the next target at a high-speed with the intention of landing directly on the target in order to quickly eliminate it. Often requires [microadjustment](#microcorrection) after the [flick](#flicking) due to the speed of the movement resulting in errors.

## Hipfire

Referring to your [FoV](#field-of-view-fov) and [sensitivity](#sensitivity) while not [aiming down sights (ADS)](#aim-down-sights-ads).

## Leading

[Aiming](#aim) in front of the target’s expected path.

## Mouse Control

The ability to move the mouse and respectively the crosshair to the position you want smoothly or to stay on target and with speed and many other factors that make good [aim](#aim) and to adapt mouse movements based on visual or audio feedback.
Your overall ability to understand and control the crosshair's position on-screen based on the physical control of your mouse in your hand.

Also known as: `Raw Aim`

## Mouse Centring

The process and skill to pick up and move the mouse to the centre of the mousepad

Also known as: `Resetting, Mouse Resetting, Centring`

## Microcorrection

A small movement of the mouse to correct the crosshair onto a target due to incorrect crosshair placement, often referring to corrections after [flicking](#flicking).

Also known as: `Microadjusting`

## Microflick

Quickly [flicking](#flicking) between targets over short distances, often in high frequency.

## Movement-Aim Indepencence

The ability to counteract the effect of strafe movement on your crosshair while simultaniously performing [aiming](#aim) tasks/skills

## Overflick

While performing a movement to acquire a target and the crosshair goes beyond the targets location or desired placement.

## Predicting

Guessing where a target is going to be in the near future based on movement patterns, and then adjusting your crosshair to align with your guess.

## Reactivity

Determining the change in movement of a target without or with minimal [prediciton](#predicting) and subsequently reacting to it - specifically, the rate at which you can do this.

## Reacquisition

The motion to place your crosshair back onto the target after it falls off due to a change of direction or speed by the target or crosshair and the target is no longer receiving damage.

## Reading (Skills)

Skills/the ability that require comprehension around where enemies are and how they are moving to predict or to better identify a target. Your overall ability to understand where the target is and where they will be based on sensory information.

## Routing

Determining the best next series of targets, forming a mental route between targets.

## Scenario

A Map/Task that is used when [aim training](#aim-training) consisting of a map and a [bot(s)](#bots)

Also known as `Task, Map`

## Sensitivity

A unit or value that fundamentally describes how much your [field of view](#field-of-view-fov) will rotate when you move your mouse an arbitrary distance.

## Smoothness

Ability to move the mouse at a controlled and consistent [speed/acceleration](#speedacceleration) (at a consistency determined by your [reading](#reading-skills)).

## Speed/Acceleration

How fast you move your crosshair from point A to point B.

## Strafe aim

The ability to change direction of movement of your own character whenever and only when the target you’re [aiming](#aim) at changes direction.

## Strafe Aim - Mirroring

Moving in the same direction as the target you are looking at. 

Example: They move right on your screen so you move right and the pattern is the same when they go left.

## Strafe Aim - Anti-mirroring

Moving in the opposite direction as the target you are looking at.

> Example: They move right on your screen so you move left and the pattern is the same when they go left.

## Strafe Aim - Half-sideways [Mirroring | Anti-mirroring]

Moving with the standard [strafe aim](#strafe-aim) techniques but has an aspect of forward and backwards movement there are four different variations two for each base technique varying which way to go forward and backwards. 

> Example (Half-sideways Mirroring): They move right on your screen so you move right and backwards then when they go left you go left and forwards.

## Switching

Moving from point A to point B as soon as possible after completing a hit or kill. Either or both of point A or B can be a static or moving target.

Also known as: `Target Switching or TS`

## Switching - Evasive

A sub-category of [switching](#switching) featuring medium [TTK](#time-to-kill-ttk) targets that frequently change direction or are difficult to track.

Also known as: `Track TS`

## Switching - Speed

A sub-category of [switching](#switching) featuring low [TTK](#time-to-kill-ttk) targets that move slowly and are eliminated in a higher frequency.

Also known as: `Flick TS`

## Target Acquisition

## Time-to-kill (TTK)

The amount of damage that must be done in order to eliminate a target. Often used in the context of high-ttk (high health) or low-ttk (low health) games.

## Tracking

The skill to maintain your crosshair on a target for a long period of time while it moves and can reacquire the same target after it changes direction. Often long [time-to-kill](#time-to-kill-ttk) targets with a high fire-rate weapon.

## Tracking - Reactive

A sub-category of [tracking](#tracing) featuring high [TTK](#time-to-kill-ttk) targets that change direction or speed often, requiring significant [reading skills](#reading-skills). In aim trainers, this category usually features bots with random, fast movement patterns and bots that teleport.

## Tracking - Precise

A sub-category of [tracking](#tracking) featuring high [TTK](#time-to-kill-ttk) targets that move in predictable patterns and challenge your ability to smoothly remain on target in order to do damage.

Also known as: `Smooth tracking`

## Tracing

How you move your crosshair from point A to point B.

Also known as: `Pathing`

## Trailing

[Aiming](#aim) behind a target’s path (or - if the target is moving - the original position of the target when it was visually selected)
