## Accuracy

Moving from point A to point B precisely. Numerically describes the amount of error when eliminating targets.

## Aim

The skill to get your crosshair on target and optimise its time on target. It is a combination of skills which include: Mouse control, positioning, movement and many more skill and abilities to achieve the goal.

## Aim Down Sights (ADS)

## Bots

In aim trainers, these are the targets that are programmed by map creators to perform actions on screen and become the targets that the player eliminates in order to improve their aim.

Also known as: `Targets, Dots`

## Clicking

The process of moving your mouse to a target to click/shoot with a semi-auto weapon.

Also known as: `Click-timing`

## Clicking - Static

A type of training scenario featuring targets that do not move which are eliminated with a single click.

Also known as: `Static dots`

## Clicking - Dynamic

A type of training scenario featuring moving targets that are eliminated with a single click.

Also known as: `Kinetic, moving dots`

## Chasing

Tracking a target by repeatedly correcting to its current position, instead of reading its movement and committing to that movement.

Also known as: `Over-predicting`

## CM/360

A universal method to calculate mouse sensitivity, literally referring to the distance required on your mousepad to perform a 360 degree turn in-game.

Also known as: `CM/rev`

## CPI

Counts of a mouse sensor per inch of real life movement. Generally used to calculate overall mouse sensitivity.

Also known as: `DPI`

## Deathgripping

When you're overly tensing your mousegrip, resulting in poor habits that can lead to injury over time.
The term 'deathgrip' comes from the negative health impacts on your arm and wrist muscles and nerves over long periods of use.

Also known as: `Overgripping`

## Field of View (FOV)

## Flicking

Quickly moving your crosshair to the next target at a high-speed with the intention of landing directly on the target in order to quickly eliminate it. Often requires microadjustment after the flick due to the speed of the movement resulting in errors.

## Hipfire

Referring to your FOV and sensitivity while not aiming down sights (ADS).

## Kovaak's Specific Scenario Naming conventions

- Air Nuns: “Air NO UFO NO SKYBOTS”
- b180, b180t, etc.: “Bounce 180,” “Bounce 180 Tracking,” etc.
- 1w6t, 1w6ts, 1w2ts reload, etc.: “1wall 6targets small,” etc.
- 1w2ts reload: Actually the name of the scenario
- CLSI, CFSI, CFSEI, etc.: “Close Long Strafes Invincible,” “Close Fast Strafes Easy Invincible,” etc.
- patts, kints, voxts, voxtarget, etc.: “patTargetSwitch,” “kinTargetSwitch,” etc.
- Pasu: The name of the guy who requested original 1w5targets pasu scenario but often refers to clicking scenarios with moving dots
- Goated: The scenario is improved in some regard that doesn't fall under the reload, thin, small, harder, easy, etc naming convention

## Leading

Aiming in front of the target’s expected path.

## Mouse Control

The ability to move the mouse and respectively the crosshair to the position you want smoothly or to stay on target and with speed and many other factors that make good aim and to adapt mouse movements based on visual or audio feedback.
Your overall ability to understand and control the crosshair's position on-screen based on the physical control of your mouse in your hand.

Also known as: `Raw Aim`

## Microcorrection

A small movement of the mouse to correct the crosshair onto a target due to incorrect crosshair placement, often referring to corrections after flicking.

Also known as: `Microadjusting`

## Microflick

Quickly flicking between targets over short distances, often in high frequency.

## Overflick

While performing a movement to acquire a target and the crosshair goes beyond the targets location or desired placement.

## Predicting

Guessing where a target is going to be in the near future based on movement patterns.

## Reactivity

Determining the change in movement of a target and subsequently reacting to it - specifically, the rate at which you can do this.

## Reacquisition

The motion to place your crosshair back onto the target after it falls off and is no longer doing damage.

## Reading (Skills)

Skills that require comprehension around where enemies are and how they are moving to predict or to better identify a target. Your overall ability to understand where the target is and where they will be based on sensory information.

## Routing

Determining the best next series of targets, forming a mental route between targets.

## Sensitivity

A unit or value that fundamentally describes how much your character model in-game will rotate when you move your mouse an arbitrary distance.

## Smoothness

Ability to move the mouse at a controlled and consistent speed/acceleration (at a consistency determined by your reading).

## Speed/Acceleration

How fast you move your crosshair from point A to point B.

## Strafe aim

The ability to change direction of movement of your own character whenever and only when the target you’re aiming at changes direction.

## Strafe Aim - Mirroring

Moving in the same direction as the target you are looking at. Example: They move right on your screen so you move right and the pattern is the same when they go left.

## Strafe Aim - Anti-mirroring

Moving in the opposite direction as the target you are looking at. Example: They move right on your screen so you move left and the pattern is the same when they go left.

## Switching

Moving from point A to point B as soon as possible after completing a hit or kill. Either or both of point A or B can be a static or moving target.

Also known as: `Target Switching or TS`

## Switching - Evasive

A sub-category of switching featuring medium TTK targets that frequently change direction or are difficult to track.

Also known as: `Track TS`

## Switching - Speed

A sub-category of switching featuring low TTK targets that move slowly and are eliminated in a higher frequency.

Also known as: `Flick TS`

## Target Acquisition

The process to acquire a target by sight, typically referring to how quickly you place your crosshair on target after they enter your field of view.

## Time-to-kill (TTK)

The amount of damage that must be done in order to eliminate a target. Often used in the context of high-ttk (health health) or low-ttk (low health) games.

## Tracking

The skill to maintain your crosshair on a target for a long period of time while it moves and can reacquire the same target after it changes direction. Often long time-to-kill targets with a high fire-rate weapon.

## Tracking - Reactive

A sub-category of tracking featuring high TTK targets that change direction or speed often, requiring significant reading skills. In aim trainers, this category usually features bots with random, fast movement patterns and bots that teleport.

## Tracking - Precise

A sub-category of tracking featuring high TTK targets that move in predictable patterns and challenge your ability to smoothly remain on target in order to do damage.

Also known as: `Smooth tracking`

## Tracing

How you move your crosshair from point A to point B.

Also known as: `Pathing`

## Trailing

Aiming behind a target’s path (or - if the target is moving - the original position of the target when it was visually selected)

Also known as: `Tailing`

## Underflick

While performing a movement to acquire a target and the crosshair lands in front of the targets location or desired placement.
